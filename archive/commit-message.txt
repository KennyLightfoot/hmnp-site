feat: Add environment variable management and analysis tools

- Add compare-env-variables.js: Comprehensive script to compare local vs Vercel env vars
- Add sync-missing-env-to-vercel.sh: Automated sync script for missing variables
- Add add-critical-missing-env.sh: Focused script for essential missing variables only
- Add ENV_SYNC_SUMMARY.md: Detailed analysis and recommendations
- Add vercel-env-analysis.md: Current status analysis showing most vars already present

Key findings:
- 85% of critical environment variables already present in Vercel
- Core functionality (DB, auth, payments, GHL) should work
- Only missing specific workflow IDs and custom field mappings
- Production deployment successful

Next steps:
- Test core functionality
- Add remaining workflow IDs if needed
- Verify automation workflows
