# Remote Online Notarization vs In-Person: Which is Better in Texas?

Texas became one of the first states to allow Remote Online Notarization (RON) in 2017, giving residents two options for notarizing documents: traditional in-person notarization and remote online notarization. But which method is right for you? This comprehensive guide compares both options to help you make an informed decision.

## What is Remote Online Notarization (RON)?

Remote Online Notarization allows you to have documents notarized via video conference with a certified RON notary. The process involves:

1. **Video call**: Connect with a notary via secure video platform
2. **Identity verification**: Verify your identity using knowledge-based authentication (KBA) or credential analysis
3. **Document review**: Review documents together on screen
4. **Electronic signing**: Sign documents electronically
5. **Notarization**: Notary applies electronic seal and signature
6. **Recording**: Session is recorded and stored securely

## What is Traditional In-Person Notarization?

Traditional notarization requires physical presence with the notary:

1. **Meet in person**: Notary comes to you or you go to them
2. **Identity verification**: Show valid photo ID
3. **Document review**: Review physical documents together
4. **Physical signing**: Sign documents with pen
5. **Notarization**: Notary applies physical seal and signature
6. **Journal entry**: Notary records in physical journal
