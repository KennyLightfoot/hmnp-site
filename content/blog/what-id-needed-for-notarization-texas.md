### Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Name on ID doesn't match document
**Solution**:
- Use your full legal name as it appears on your ID

**Problem**: ID is damaged or unreadable
**Solution**:
- Use an alternative valid ID

- Witness must personally know you
- Witness must have valid ID (if serving as single witness)
- Witness must be present at notarization

5. Notarization proceeds

## What to Bring to Your Notary Appointment

2. **Compare photo**: Ensure photo matches you
3. **Verify signature**: May compare to signature on document
4. **Check physical description**: Verify height, weight, eye color match
5. **Record in journal**: Document ID type and number (required in Texas)

### What You Should Do:
1. **Present ID promptly**: Have ID ready when notary arrives
2. **Ensure ID is current**: Check expiration date before appointment
3. **Match your appearance**: ID photo should look like you
4. **Sign consistently**: Use signature that matches your ID
