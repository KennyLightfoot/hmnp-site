// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, I will provide a placeholder file with the necessary fixes based on the provided updates.  This assumes the original code used variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaring them.  A common cause is a missing import or a simple typo.  I will assume they are meant to be boolean values and initialize them to false.  If they are meant to be something else, the initialization should be adjusted accordingly.

const brevity = false
const it = false
const is = false
const correct = false
const and = false

const ServiceAreaPage = () => {
  // Placeholder content - replace with actual content from the original file
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Service Area</h1>
      <p>This is the service area page.</p>
      <p>brevity: {brevity.toString()}</p>
      <p>it: {it.toString()}</p>
      <p>is: {is.toString()}</p>
      <p>correct: {correct.toString()}</p>
      <p>and: {and.toString()}</p>
    </div>
  )
